## Project Work

### Part 1
- Found deep learning model known as FireBaseTextRecognizer
- Designed UI of the notes application
- Implemented deep learning model on-device and off-device
- Implemented upload to another application such as Gmail
- Measured inference latency
- Made video demo of the application
- Wrote design doc explaining features

### Part 2
- Ran startup time, inference time, memory usage, CPU usage, and energy usage tests on the application
- Wrote performance report discussing observations and analysis

### Part 3
- Optimized app startup time
- Wrote codelab for the optimization process
